# Today's Objective: Script Runner Chrome Extension

## Objective

Today's objective is to create your own Script Runner for Chrome.

Script runners are tools that let you create, save, edit, and execute pieces of code. Chrome extensions are a particularly useful platform when it comes to creating JavaScript script runners for specific websites.

Some very well-known ones include:
* [ViolentMonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag?hl=en)
* [TamperMonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
* [AceScript for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ace-script/mjbepbhonbojpoaenhckjocchgfiaofo?hl=en)

## Requirements

* `IMPORTANT` For security purposes, I will NOT be installing anyone's extensions on my local machine. To get Aesthetic points for your extension, please upload a 1 to 2 minute demo of the extension.

So, this is your task:

1. Please install some of the above extensions and take them for a spin, building your own scripts and seeing how they work.
2. Create a Chrome extension that replicates the functionality above. Namely, build an extension that will let you create, save, edit, and execute snippets of JS code. 

That's it!

But of course, only the most interesting, useful, and cool designs will have a chance of winning -- and they must be written well, too. So, get creative :-)


### How to build a Chrome extension

A Chrome extension is basically a `.zip` file. This project will contain a simple HTML page and some JS files zipped into a Chrome extension.

Given time constraints, you should definitely NOT build a backend component for this project.

You can read the following resource to get familiar with how to create a chrome extension:
* [Chrome Extension documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions)

### Frameworks:

Using a framework is not necessary. Plain vanilla JS will do just fine.

However, if you're building something complex, it is recommended that you use a framework such as React, Vue or Angular.

## Restrictions

* Your project must use JavaScript.
* Your project must NOT have a backend component. (It really isn't needed)
* `IMPORTANT` For security purposes, I will NOT be installing anyone's extensions on my local machine. To get Aesthetic points for your extension, please upload a 1 to 2 minute demo of the extension.

There are no other restrictions.

## Tips for success:

1. The project is intentionally simple so you can focus on code quality.
1. The requirements are intentionally minimalistic so you can get as creative as you'd like.
1. You get a LOT of time for code review comments. So you can win even if you feel your project isn't great, simply on the strength of your code review comments!
1. Keep in mind, 33% of your score is based on aesthetic appeal! So try to make it look nice.
